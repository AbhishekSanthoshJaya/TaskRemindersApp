## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Create a native application for iPhone or iPad (or Universal) that allows the user to schedule and be reminded of his/her tasks. Your application should allow users to add a task with a description
as a goal along with the number of days needed to complete the task. Tasks should be added in a table and the user should be able to edit the tasks as well. You are supposed to categorize your
tasks as well

## FUNCTIONALITIES IMPLEMENTED
* User can add a task, a short optional description and set a due date
* User can create a new category and add tasks into that category
* Tasks can be sorted using date of creation or name
* Tasks that are due have a green cell color and tasks that are overdue are red in color
* Tasks can be moved from one category to another
* All the tasks in a category can be search for using a keyword
* User can delete a task with a left swipe
* User can move a task or mark it as done with a right swipe of the  cell
* The user receives a notification a day before the task is due
* An archived folder contains all completed tasks.
* Already added tasks can be edited by clicking on the cell
* Data persistence is achieved through CoreData
